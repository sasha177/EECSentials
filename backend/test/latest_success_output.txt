I recommend EECS471(Applied Parallel Programming with GPUs), EECS482 (Introduction to Operating Systems), and EECS483 (0Compiler Construction). Each of these classes have a moderate amount of workload involving programming assignments, projects, and substantial programs. They are all four-credit classes, and the median grades for each class are A-, B+, and A respectively. All of them require EECS281 and EECS370 as prerequisites. Would you like to hear more about any of these classes?

You: can i hear about the combined workload?

The workload between the classes isn't too different. EECS471 has no specified workload, while EECS482 has a workload of 81%. Finally, EECS483 has a workload of 35%. Would you like to hear more about any of these classes specifically?

You: could i take these classes together?

Yes, you could take these classes together. However, the workload might be difficult to manage considering that all the classes involve writing substantial programs and programming assignments. Additionally, all three classes have the same prerequisites, so you will need to make sure that you complete those before taking these classes. Is there anything else I can help you with?

You: no, i'd like to hear about other classes

[388, 370]

Assistant: You should take EECS 370 (Introduction to Computer Organization) and EECS 388 (Introduction to Computer Security). EECS 370 covers basic concepts of computer organization and hardware while EECS 388 introduces the principles and practices of computer security as applied to software, host systems, and networks. The workload for both of these classes is relatively light, with EECS 370 requiring 30% and EECS 388 needing 25%. Both classes have prerequisites, so make sure you complete those before enrolling. Do you want to hear more about these classes?

You: what would i be likely to get in the class? and do the topics covered in each class overlap>

Assistant: The median grade for EECS 370 is a B+ and the median grade for EECS 388 is an A-. As for overlap, there may be some overlap between the topics covered in each class, but they have different focuses. For example, EECS 370 covers basic concepts of hardware while EECS 388 focuses on principles and practices of computer security. Would you like specifics about the topics covered in each class?

You: no, i'm good. thank you
