You should take EECS 442 (Computer Vision) and EECS 449 (Conversational AI). Computer Vision is an introduction to 2D and 3D computer vision covering camera models for multiple views, shape reconstruction methods from visual cues, low-level and high-level vision problems such as object recognition and scene understanding. Conversational AI covers areas in Computer Science including natural language processing, dialogue management, response generation and other applications. Both classes have a workload of 19%, 4 credits and require prerequisites from either EECS 281, MATH 214/217/296/417/419/ROB101 for Computer Vision, or EECS 281 for Conversational AI.

 Assistant: Sure, those classes are EECS 543 (Knowledge-Based Systems) and EECS 545 (Machine Learning). Knowledge-Based Systems focuses on techniques for developing software that utilize explicit representations of domain knowledge and Machine Learning focuses on different methods of supervised, unsupervised and sequential learning. The workload for both courses is similar with Machine Learning having a slightly higher percentage. Both courses require no prerequisites and offer 3 credits each.
